    This layer is an unusual layer.  It combines the Softmax activation and the cross-

    The reason we do this is because of how the backpropagation equations are derived.
    It is actually rather challenging to separate the derivatives of the softmax from
    the derivatives of the cross-entropy loss.

    So this layer simply computes the derivatives for both the softmax and the cross-entropy
    at the same time.

    But at the same time, it has two outputs: The loss, used for backpropagation, and
    the classifications, used at runtime when training the network.

    TODO: Create a self.classifications property that contains the classification output,
    and use self.output for the loss output.

    See https://www.d2l.ai/chapter_linear-networks/softmax-regression.html#loss-function
    in our textbook.

    Another unusual thing about this layer is that it does NOT compute the gradients in y.
